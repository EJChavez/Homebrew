This project was made due to the inherent DM reliance on the Wild Magic Sorcerer Subclass, So I made some homebrew changes that gives the player
more or less "Control" over it. Originally (http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:wild-magic) it is entirely up to the DM to decide whether or not 
the player will ever get to actually surge, which means you either have DM's that will constantly have you surge every other spell, or you have
DM's that won't ever have you roll on the table, negating the entire purpose of the subclass.

Thus the changes I made from the original class are minimal to keep the spirit of the original impact, while giving the player more urgency,
I also increased the amount of possible options on the wild surge table from 50 to 200. This modified wild surge table has roughly the same 
ratio of Good/Neutral/Bad effects that the original has, but will ensure more variety.

Changes:
1. The Player Rolls after every spell cast above level 1
2. When Tides of Chaos has been used, the roll that causes a surge is significantly increased
3. The DM can choose to have the player surge whenever Tides of Chaos has been used, not just after casting a spell
4. Modified Surge Table
5. A player may choose to take a point of exhaustion rather than have a surge take effect
6. Added Wild Magic Metamagic Option

If you use this homebrew, feel free to comment to let me know how it feels, As time passes I may add more options to the surge table or include
different surge tables that other people have made, (perhaps the crazy 10,000 option surge table).
